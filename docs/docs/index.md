# Introduction
Folder notes is a plugin for the note taking app  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets you attach notes to folders so that you can click on the name of a folder to open the note like in the app [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
This plugin has some unique features that separate it from similar "Folder note" plugins like opening folder notes through the path, creating folder notes for every existing folder, templater/template support and more.
